# About SRMaio
These is a all-in-one app which contains all the requirement of the collage students. We made these app as a part of 24 hour hackathon RUSH 3.0 which is conducted in our collage SRMIST,Ramapuram,Chennai.<br>
We won #3 prize for this app because of complete product which has everything that an app should have i.e. user interface for students and controllers and simplicity of app that can be easily edited by the controller itself no need for an app designer to redesign the app.
Here is all the documentation needed for this app. 
## Problem Statement 
This is the original problem statement given to us 
### All-in-one university support
All-in-one app where we can have complete smart services for university related to cleaniness, lost and found, canteen Orders, Event Notification, etc. <br>
You think standing in the queue and then ordering food and then waiting for the food to get ready is wasting of time? Yeah me too. How we could oder the food after the lectures/before reaching the canteen itself and the food get ready before you get there.<br>
So, you have found your earphone and not sure where you're supposed to report it? Found dirt in your classroom and don't know the appropiate authority to report it? Could we directly report this in app and the appropiate authority will take care of the situation.
## Ideation
We four sat around and came up with the Idea with proper ideation process.<br>
<br>
<br>
We decided to create a multiscreen android app which will have a login page and a security feature, Contents of the app, cleaniness reporting page, Canteen Ordering page, Lost and found page and event notification page.
